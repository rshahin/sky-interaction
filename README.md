## Sky Diagnostics

## Initial thoughts: 

On first glance, the design seem to be spot on, it felt like a case of why fix something that's not broken. Which it still is. The essentials are all there and the site is easy to navigate.

The first requirement of the assignment I felt was that the design had to work with the rest of the sky websites. Which meant I discarded the idea of a complete redesign from the get go. I’m using the word loosely but history tells us that radical redesign doesn’t always lead to good reaction from people. Digg tried to do it and failed, so did Yahoo mail. Given the scale of the site I felt that it was important to keep the site familiar and not alienate existing/registered visitors but at the same time, use the existing design and space to improve user experience. A quick research led me to http://www.skymedia.co.uk/Audience-Insight/online-research.aspx which showed that when it comes to Sky homepage and Sky portal, the demographic consist of both the younger and older generation with the former slightly ahead. This means that more of the visitors to the site are younger and most likely be familiar with existing navigational practices found of websites on a general basis and further addition to the site’s design will not alienate them. 

* The site fundamentally a test unit and some of the features might not act as they should.

## Changes and logic: 

#1. 
The first thing I changed was the layout of the site, but not radically. I felt that the site needed more white space and font size could use an increase as well given how there are countless screen sizes out there at the moment. Overall, it roughly the same as the old layout, but slightly roomier. 

#2. 
The second thing that I felt needed some improvement was the section header, the space could be used to further improve user options when they visit the site to find a problem they are looking for. On the new design, breadcrumb shows the visitor where they are in relation to the help section with the Title of the chosen problem under it. I felt that it was important given the fact that Sky TV is not the only service Sky provides and this should indicate that TV help is a sub-category under the HELP parent-category. On the right there’s a down-arrow button that opens a drop down menu that allows quick access to most frequent links/issues.


#3. 
The search field with auto-completion is a powerful tool, I think the current position is quite spot on and doesn’t need any improvement. However, a drop down menu to narrow the search down to specific category should make the search journey more efficient and more pleasant. Which is why I’ve added one.


#4. 
On to the most important section of the site/page, the section where a visitor selects the issue they are experiencing. I’ve added a button with a short description of the problem which I think compliments the image below and gets highlighted when the image/div is hovered, indicating it’s a call-to-action section that interacts with user input such as a click. It also makes sure that it’s all understandable even if the images fail to load.

The images now have a zoom icon on them that should well indicate to a visitor that bigger versions of the images can be accessed should the images turn out to be not too legible. This should be an advantage throughout the help site regardless of which page a visitor is on.


#5.
Although upon click the solution is usually loaded in an instant, I felt that this speed could be utilised to improve the experience by adding some fluid movement as opposed to a sudden load. On my proposed experience, a new section is opened and the page scrolls down to said section when one of the three issues is clicked on. The previously mentioned button remains highlighted to indicate which issue the new section relates to. There’s a CLOSE button available as well that closes the new section and scroll the page up to the three issues section without leaving the page. 


#6.
The weather check section now shows animated weather-condition as opposed to a static icon. I feel that Sky’s being an entertainment company should flow into the help section as well. I’ve only implemented a simple snow falling animation, other weather conditions can be animated as needed as well. 


#7 Responsiveness:
There are two break points, one for phones and another for tablet screens. I made the issue sections stretch to 100% on tablets as well as I felt three columns on smaller tablets might not be very legible, plus people usually hold tablets a fair bit further than phones. 

The phone version header is not quite interactive as of now, I’m still working on it, it’s roughly the same as the current one, except the search field is not visible under the logo and menu button, I wouldn’t have bothered with any other site but given the scope of this site, it could be important. However, I feel more user feedback/behavioural data is required to make a final decision.
